// The Raspberry Pi Pico is a general development board.
// The following provides a sample of user-customized code to USBemani.

// All code should start by including the main "usbemani.h" file. This provides access to system functions
#include "usbemani.h"

/*** PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING:
  USBemani provides a number of callback functions that are invoked by the system.
  A number of these callbacks are available for the user to override and insert their own custom functionality.
  The following will provide examples on how to use these callbacks and the available APIs.
*/

/*** Definitions ***/
// We can define our own variables for use by our code.
// For our example controller, we'll define a variable to hold a rainbow effect that we'll draw around our turntable.
// Additionally, we'll only draw this RGB ring for _fallback_ lighting, when no USB HID lighting data is available.
// If this data is available, we'll draw that instead.

// We'll make a new Effect_Rainbow_t for our rainbow effect. This takes in the following parameters, as defined in common/effect.h:
//  * The RGB channel we'll draw to. We only have one RGB channel, so this will be 0.
//  * The first LED to draw to. LEDs are 0-indexed.
//    * Our example controller has 11 RGB LEDs for buttons, followed by our turntable. So, our first LED will be index 11.
//    * We can get this with our user defines we setup earlier: (BUTTONS_ACTIVE * RGB_LEDS_PER_KEY).
//  * The number of LEDs to draw.
//    * We defined that earlier as well, as RGB_LEDS_PER_TURNTABLE.
//  * The direction to draw our LEDs in. `false` draws LEDs from left-to-right, whereas `true` draws LEDs from right-to-left.

/*** RGB Lighting ***/
// For our example, we'll use this along with the input of our controller to calculate a brightness value.
// Any time there's motion, we'll make the right bright.
